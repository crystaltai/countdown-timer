## Summary

### What I learned

4/20/22

- Practiced creating a class Timer and instantiating a new instance of it
  - Used a constructor function to accept arguments that would be accessible by the methods of the class
  - Also passed in a callbacks parameter to the constructor function, to accept callback functions added during the instantiation of a new Timer
    - Since the callback functions were passed into the constructor function, the class's methods were able to access them
  - Used getter and setter functions to get the time input value and set the input value, respectively
    - Using getter and setter functions allowed me to pass the logic as an instance variable (instead of a function)
- Created first circle using an SVG element, positioning and sizing the circle to fit around the timer and timer controls
  - Learned to use fill, stroke and stroke-dashoffset properties to illustrate a visual countdown
